# Recipe Finder
The Recipe Finder endeavors to be the largest and easiest to search collection of free, public-domain recipes in the world.

The Recipe Finder allows you to search a repository of recipes ("Discover"), Bookmark recipes you like ("Bookmarks"), find recipes you can make with ingredients on-hand ("What Can I Make?"), and create a shopping list ("Shopping List").
